# drupal-ops-toolkit

Personal automation for day-to-day Drupal work: deploy pipelines over SSH,
visual checks, smoke tests and AI-assisted code review.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
cp examples/dops.config.example.yml dops.config.yml   # adjust targets and pipelines

npx dops pipelines                    # what can I run?
npx dops deploy cache-clear --dry-run # show the commands per target
npx dops deploy deploy                # run it, with live output
npx dops history                      # previous runs
npx dops history show <run-id>        # steps and full output of one run
```

Pipelines are lists of shell steps that run on one or more targets, through
a bastion when needed. A failing step stops the run; later targets are
skipped so a broken release never reaches every server.

SSH uses your key file or agent. No passwords are stored in the config.

## Dashboard

```bash
npm run build                 # builds the React dashboard once
npx dops serve                # http://127.0.0.1:4800
```

The dashboard lists pipelines, starts runs on chosen targets and sites,
streams their output live and keeps the run history. It only listens on
localhost and every API call needs a token (`DOPS_TOKEN`, or the one printed
on start). Exposing it on another interface requires `DOPS_ALLOW_REMOTE=1`.
